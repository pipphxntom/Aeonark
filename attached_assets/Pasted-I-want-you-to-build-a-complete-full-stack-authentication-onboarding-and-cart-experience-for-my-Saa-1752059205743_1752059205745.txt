I want you to build a complete full-stack authentication, onboarding, and cart experience for my SaaS platform called Aeonark Labs, which offers web, AI agent, and data services. This flow should mirror the smoothness of platforms like Replit or Notion. When a user clicks the "Choose Plan" button on the pricing section of the Aeonark Labs site, they should be redirected to a dedicated authentication page that contains two tabs‚ÄîLogin and Signup‚Äîdesigned with a dark-mode UI aesthetic, consistent with Aeonark‚Äôs branding (black background with neon green and blue highlights). This page should only ask for the user's email address (no password), and upon submission, it should generate a 6-digit OTP using the Resend API and email it to the user for verification. Use Redis (or in-memory cache) to temporarily store the OTP with an expiry time, and validate it securely without revealing match attempts to prevent brute-force abuse. Upon successful OTP verification, the backend should issue a secure session (JWT or httpOnly cookie) and immediately redirect the user to a clean onboarding screen. This onboarding step should collect lightweight personalization details including the user‚Äôs full name, an optional company/startup name, their primary goal for using Aeonark Labs (chosen from a dropdown like ‚ÄúWebsite,‚Äù ‚ÄúAI Agent,‚Äù ‚ÄúAnalytics Platform,‚Äù or ‚ÄúOther‚Äù), and an open-ended sentence for what they want to build. This form should be skippable but if completed, should tag the user as "onboarded" in the database so that future logins skip this page. After onboarding, the user should be redirected to the Cart or Plan Review page, where the plan they initially clicked ("Starter Site," "Growth Bundle," or "Scale Forge") is automatically shown, alongside optional add-ons like AI chatbot, mobile app wrapper, or maintenance. If the user was already logged in from a previous session, the onboarding step should be skipped and they should land directly on the Cart page. The cart page should display their saved details (like name, email, and plan selection) and should offer a seamless way to proceed to checkout. In the backend, once a new user completes the signup and onboarding process and views the cart, an email must be automatically triggered to aeonark.lab@gmail.com using Resend. The subject of the email should be "üß† New User Joined Aeonark Labs", and the body should contain the user‚Äôs name, email, selected pricing plan, and their stated goal for using Aeonark. The system should store all user info and session securely in PostgreSQL (or Supabase) and ensure smooth persistence across login sessions. Each user‚Äôs login should avoid repeated prompts for the same questions and retain their previous selections and preferences. All email flows‚Äîboth for OTP verification and internal admin alerts‚Äîshould be handled through Resend. This entire system should be built using Next.js (App Router) or Node.js + React, styled with Tailwind CSS, and follow a modern, enterprise SaaS design system. Folder structure should include proper /pages for pricing, authentication, onboarding, and cart, and /api routes to handle OTP logic, user updates, and admin alerts. You may persist intermediate state using localStorage or URL parameters where needed, but prioritize clean UX and maintain full frontend/backend synchronization. This authentication and onboarding flow will be the foundation of Aeonark‚Äôs user platform and should be treated as production-grade, resilient to misuse, and intuitive enough to make first-time users feel like they‚Äôre entering a premium SaaS ecosystem.
